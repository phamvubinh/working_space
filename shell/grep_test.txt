In this tutorial you'll learn to use 'grep' to find patterns in text files. 'grep' is a really important command and I am surprised why I didn't discuss it earlier in the course. Anyway, I hope you guys like the tutorial. We have forty three tutorials in the course and still there is so much more to discuss. That attests to my slow speed and shell's power and extent. I'll try to pick some speed and make the course more interesting for us all.
