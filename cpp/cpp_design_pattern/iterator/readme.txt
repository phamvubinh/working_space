# Iterator
Iterator pattern has behavioral purpose and applies to objects.
The pattern provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation

# when to use
* to access an aggregate object's contents without exposing its internal representation
* to support multiple traversals of aggregate objects
* to provide a uniform interface for traversing different aggregate strutures
(to support polymorphic iteration)
