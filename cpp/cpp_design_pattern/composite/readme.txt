# composite

Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierachies.
Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositios of objects uniformly.
The pattern has structural purpose and applies to objects.

# when to use
* you want to represent part-whole hierachies of objects
* you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between composittions of objects and individual objects
