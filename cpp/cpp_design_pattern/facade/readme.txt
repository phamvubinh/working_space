# Facade
- Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
- Facade defines a higher-level interface that make the subsystem easier to use.
- The pattern has strutural purpose and applies to objects.

# When to use
* you want to provide a simple interface to a complex system
* there are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction
* you want to layer your subsystem, use a facade to define an entry point to each subsystem level
