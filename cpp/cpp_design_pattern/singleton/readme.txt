#Singleton

- Ensure a class has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

- Pattern has creational purpose and deals with object relationships, which are more dynamic.

- The Singleton is often used as a part of other design pattern (Facade and Flyweight)

# When to use
* There must be exactly one instance of a classm and it must be accesible to clients form a well-know access point

* When the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be able to use a extended instance without modifying their code
